Note: you will need to have access to an installation of rootpy and root_numpy to use the 
root functions, which in turn needs pyROOT and a full ROOT installation. I could not get 
this to work on the cluster, but it's possible, I just didn't take the time to do it, but 
it should be easy to do on your own machine
